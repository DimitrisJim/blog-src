Title: About myself
Slug: about-me
Authors: Jim Fasarakis-Hilliard

Introductions are always a pain. My name is Jim, I currently live in Athens
but was born in a coastal town in Wales called [Aberystwyth][1]. If you think that
name has many consonants, you shouldn't see [this video][2].

I like Python, have developed Stockholm syndrome with C and C++ and use Javascript
on occasions because its ubiquitous; for all you know I could be a JS bot.

Follow or -- if that's your thing -- stalk me on any of the social platforms listed
